## Ohai there, Kraken eleven

Man, it's been a while!

Firstly, hey, how are you doing? 2020 has been notably tough on all of us in different ways. Most of us were either stuck indoors
or uncomfortably out and about for most of last year. It affected every industry, company, and project in a different way. Given that
Kraken has developers spanning the globe, our contributors all felt last year to varying extents - but what is a community if
not to be there for its members, and give them something to spend all that time stuck inside working on :).

With that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android 11's release last August to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google's fairly large changes in Android 10, we were able to rebase our changes onto Android 11 much more
efficiently. This led to a lot of time to spend on cool new features!

As always, let's talk about versioning conventions - you may be thinking "Shouldn't this be eleven, as AOSP is on 11, and not 11.1?".
As we stated in our last blog post, after ten, whenever we conduct a platform wide rebase, we will be incrementing our minor version.
So, when we rebased on the December Android Security Bulletin (ASB) due to its fairly massive changes, Kraken eleven was born.

### New Features!

* Security patches from April 2020 to March 2021 have been merged to Kraken oreo through eleven.
  * eleven builds are currently based on the android-11.0.0_r32 tag, which is the Pixel series unified tag.
* Wi-Fi display is available for newer Qualcomm devices, on a device-by-device basis.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 89.0.4389.105.
* Our Recorder app has been vastly improved in more ways than can be counted, go leave yourself a voice-memo so you don't forget that great idea!
  * Screen recording has been moved to a QS tile to match AOSP's behavior.
  * The user interface has been revamped and there's also now a UI for easily viewing, managing, and sharing your voice notes.
  * It's now possible to choose the quality of your audio recordings to save space.
  * It's now possible to pause and resume recordings.
* The FOSS [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar) app has been forked, improved, and shipped in place of the stagnant and largely unmaintained AOSP calendar.
* The Calyx institute's FOSS [Seedvault](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android) application has been included as a built-in backup solution.
  * To use it, navigate to Settings -> System -> Backup, and "Change backup provider" to Seedvault. You can then click "Seedvault Backup" to configure, schedule, and encrypt backups!
  * Backups created with Seedvault can be uploaded on your Nextcloud instance, an external USB drive or kept on your local storage.
* There is now an option on non-A/B devices to update the recovery image alongside the OS, just as the stock OS would!
  * To use this, either enable the option during the initial device setup or navigate to Settings -> System -> (Show More) Updater -> Three Dot Menu in the top right -> and check "Update recovery alongside OS".
* Our music app, Eleven now has a more up-to-date UI and integrates nicely with all the new android features for music players such as seeking from the notification.
* All Kraken apps now have support for dark mode.
* (ten too) Our recovery now has a new, colorful, and fun UI that is much more accessible.
* (ten too) The firewall can block all connections now by making apps think that the device is in airplane mode.
* (ten too) We've introduced a new expandable volume dialog UI that allows you to control multiple volume streams more easily.
* (ten too) The partial screenshot feature has been improved with a new UI that's easier to use. On eleven it also integrates nicely with the new Android's "instant screenshot". Long press the screenshot button in the power menu and give it a try!
* (ten too) Trebuchet now supports icon packs.
* (ten too) ADB root was reworked to ensure compatibility with other 3rd party root solutions.

### Generic Targets

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, in an effort to make Kraken more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving Kraken a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.aospk.org/emulator.html)! This enables the average person to build and run Kraken on their local PC.

Additionally, these same targets can now be used to build GSI's in both mobile and Android TV configurations, making Kraken more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets due to the fact the user-experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

### Sensitive phone numbers

In [Changelog 10](https://aospk.org/Changelog-10/) we introduced the feature that some sensitive phone numbers are automatically hidden from the call log.\\
For world suicide prevention day we [asked you on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/d2n7p0/world_suicide_prevention_day/) about additional numbers for your countries.\\
Kraken eleven now finally makes use of all that information and introduces a helpline contact list (just look at the 3-dot menu in the dialer to find it).
In addition to quickly being able to find and call any of these numbers, we also show names, languages, websites, and categories for many of them.
To improve upon that we want to ask you to have a look at the [existing list](https://github.com/AOSPK/vendor_aosp/blob/eleven/prebuilt/common/etc/sensitive_pn.xml)
and let us know of any additional numbers or information for existing ones.

### Addon.d-v3

For all the addon creators out there, addon.d now supports extra system partitions.
This means that you can now backup and restore files in `/vendor`, `/product`, and `/system_ext` without any extra work.

For a reference addon.d script, you may refer to this [example gist](https://pastebin.com/raw/SEEDsuP3).
For interface and implementation details, please refer to the documentation and the code in [the implementing commit](https://github.com/AOSPK/vendor_aosp/commit/c63fa8441bb5ad1fc4fb68155a5e5166aa25cac0).

### Engineering Blog

We know it's been a while since we posted on our [Engineering Blog](https://aospk.org/engineering), but contributors Aayush Gupta (theimpulson)
and Nolen Johnson (npjohnson) recently posted a comprehensive piece on working with SELinux on Android! Just about everyone can benefit from giving
it a read, it's written in a way that both aspiring, and seasoned developers will learn something new. You can read it [here](https://aospk.org/engineering/HowTo-SELinux)!

### Deprecations

On the whole, we feel that the eleven branch has reached feature and stability parity with ten and is ready for initial release.

Kraken pie builds stopped on February 15th, 2021, to allow space on our infrastructure to begin testing Kraken eleven.

Kraken eleven will launch building for a fairly wide selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/AOSPK/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to Kraken eleven

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.aospk.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install Kraken for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.aospk.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [Kraken Wiki](https://wiki.aospk.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.aospk.org/devices/) as given the complexity introduced AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab) found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of pie, maintainers have
been expected to run through the full instructions, and verify they work on their devices. The Kraken Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's individual installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.aospk.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official, but no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you review it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission, and if it's up to par, invited to our communications
instances, and your device forked to Kraken's official repos.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other thing you can contribute to:
for instance our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.aospk.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)aospk.org detailing them, and we'll get
you in the loop.

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate Kraken to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach us out on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, Kraken is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
